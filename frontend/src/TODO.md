# TODO: Fix Enrollment Error in CourseDetail.jsx

- [x] Modify handleEnroll function in frontend/src/pages/student/CourseDetail.jsx to handle "Already enrolled" error gracefully:
  - Check if err.response?.data?.message === "Already enrolled"
  - If true, set enrolled to true, update localStorage with the course ID, and alert a success/info message
  - This prevents error alerts when user is already enrolled but localStorage is outdated
- [x] Test the enrollment flow to ensure no more 400 errors for already enrolled users
